Once the program has started, you will be prompted to enter input on lines
containing '>'. All the commands follow a basic structure with the command
being the first string and can be followed by more strings which should be
seperated by a space.
Type help to get the full list of commands or type "info [commandName]" to get$

Examples:

> test
> add 50 2
> bitcount 15
> info exit

Note: There is a bug with the multiply function where if you call it once,
it will function as intented but any other command called after will produce e$
This will be fixed in the final version.
